my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !####[([8], 'POS')]
the pizza and wine were excellent - the service too -- but what really made this place was the backyard dining area .####[([1], 'POS'), ([3], 'POS'), ([8], 'POS'), ([19, 20, 21], 'POS')]
it is one the nicest outdoor restaurants i have ever seen in ny -- i am from italy and this place rivals the ones in my country .####[([5, 6], 'POS')]

first of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by citysearch 's editorial review .####[([5], 'NEG')]
the tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([9], 'NEU'), ([19, 20], 'NEG')]
slightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .####[([3], 'NEG')]
service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .####[([0], 'NEG')]
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service .####[([13], 'NEG')]
to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora .####[([11], 'POS'), ([29], 'NEG')]
not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .####[([4], 'NEG'), ([13, 14, 15, 16], 'NEG')]
fish was overdone .####[([0], 'NEG')]
cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again .####[([4, 5], 'POS'), ([1], 'POS')]

i 've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years : a new jazz bar , the most fantastic dining garden , the best thin crust pizzas , and now a lasagna menu which is to die for ( these are not your average lasagnas ) !####[([24, 25], 'POS'), ([18, 19], 'POS'), ([29, 30, 31], 'POS'), ([36, 37], 'POS')]
