my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !####[([8], 'POS')]

first of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by citysearch 's editorial review .####[([5], 'NEG')]
the tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([9], 'NEU'), ([19, 20], 'NEG')]
slightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .####[([3], 'NEG')]
service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .####[([0], 'NEG')]
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service .####[([13], 'NEG')]
to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora .####[([11], 'POS'), ([29], 'NEG')]
not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .####[([4], 'NEG'), ([13, 14, 15, 16], 'NEG')]
fish was overdone .####[([0], 'NEG')]

i 've had my fair share of modern japanese and this spot delivers .####[([7, 8], 'POS')]
the atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking , which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([21, 22, 23], 'NEG')]

not a very fancy place but very good chinese style indian food .####[([4], 'NEU'), ([8, 9, 10, 11], 'POS')]
the chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes ( i have to agree with a previous reviewer ) are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the chilli chicken .####[([1, 2], 'POS'), ([10], 'NEG'), ([30, 31], 'NEG')]
my mom originally introduced me to this place , but even she ( being indian ) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily .####[([18], 'NEG')]
i was speechless by the horrible food .####[([6], 'NEG')]
i attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing .####[([11], 'NEG')]
rather than preparing vegetarian dish , the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables ( minus sauce , seasoning , or any form or aesthetic presentation ) .####[([7], 'NEG'), ([3, 4], 'NEG')]
this place survives on reputation alone .####[([1], 'NEG')]
this is the most wonderful restaurant in all of new york city , not just brooklyn ...####[([5], 'POS')]

great hot dogs ..####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost !####[([1], 'POS'), ([4], 'POS')]
for me dishes a little oily , but overall dining experience good .####[([2], 'NEG')]
helpful service and average price per dish $ 10 .####[([1], 'POS'), ([6], 'POS')]

this establishment is the real deal .####[([1], 'POS')]
wish ny had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .####[([13], 'POS')]
but $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include wine ?####[([5, 6, 7], 'NEG')]
look , the appetizers were really good .####[([3], 'POS')]
the entree was also very good .####[([1], 'POS')]
what you are paying for is the environment and the name .####[([7], 'NEU')]
yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .####[([3], 'POS')]
vanison was good but not amazing .####[([0], 'NEU')]
bison was quite excellent however .####[([0], 'POS')]
dessert : pure disaster .####[([0], 'NEG')]
i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .####[([6], 'NEG')]
the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say " i 've been to the four seasons restaurant " .####[([0, 1, 2], 'NEU')]
all in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) .####[([5], 'POS'), ([12], 'NEG')]
the environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts .####[([1], 'NEU')]
if you are going for the food , it will not be worth it .####[([6], 'NEG')]
you would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .####[([10], 'NEG')]
service was just ok , it is not what you 'd expect for $ 500 .####[([0], 'NEG')]
i agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience !####[([5, 6, 7], 'NEG')]
i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .####[([8, 9, 10], 'NEG')]
we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table .####[([16], 'NEU')]
the place is beautiful !####[([1], 'POS')]
the hostess was very pleasant .####[([1], 'POS')]
however , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible !####[([5], 'NEG')]
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka .####[([9], 'NEG')]
after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .####[([9], 'NEG')]
we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .####[([6], 'NEG')]
my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .####[([1], 'NEG')]
i would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner .####[([9], 'NEG')]
by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !####[([42], 'NEG')]
if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !####[([21], 'NEG')]
i have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money .####[([5], 'NEG')]
the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions .####[([1], 'NEU')]
there was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .####[([4], 'NEG')]
not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with brahma .####[([4, 5, 6, 7], 'NEG')]
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) .####[([11, 12, 13, 14], 'POS')]
the lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless .####[([1, 2], 'NEU')]
i believe there were 2 shrimp in the " salt encrusted shrimp " appetizer .####[([8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], 'NEG')]
i had the thai style fried sea bass ... which was very good .####[([3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'POS')]
everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi , seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice !####[([6], 'POS'), ([14, 15, 16], 'NEG')]
i heard the lobster roll was excellent .####[([3, 4], 'POS')]
all in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side , but fresh .####[([4], 'POS')]
service not the friendliest to our " large party " !####[([0], 'NEG')]
great indian food####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
food was amazing - i love indian food and eat it quite regularly , but i can say this is one of the best i 've had .####[([0], 'POS')]
very " normal indian food " , but done really well .####[([3, 4], 'NEU')]
i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this place does n't have an upscale feel .####[([39], 'POS'), ([14, 15, 16], 'NEG'), ([45], 'NEG')]
also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .####[([2], 'NEG')]
but if you 're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for indian food####[([28, 29], 'POS'), ([24], 'NEG')]
bukhara grill , the tagline says it all .. " indian spice rave "####[([0, 1], 'POS')]
the lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it .####[([1, 2], 'NEG')]
we have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given .####[([15], 'POS'), ([4], 'POS')]
bukhara is on my top 5 indian places in nyc####[([0], 'POS')]
i have never been so disgusted by both food an service .####[([8], 'NEG'), ([10], 'NEG')]
however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####[([38], 'NEG'), ([15, 16], 'NEG')]
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .####[([8], 'NEG')]
my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .####[([24], 'NEG')]
it was n't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it 's simply repulsive .####[([6], 'NEG')]
gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner####[([1], 'POS')]
i book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot .####[([10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'POS'), ([4, 5, 6], 'POS')]
the service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing !####[([1], 'POS'), ([6], 'POS')]
i completely recommend casa la femme for any special occasion and to really impress your date .####[([3, 4, 5], 'POS')]
the bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n't even close to sizzling .####[([1], 'NEU'), ([7, 8], 'NEG')]
too bad i had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl .####[([11, 12], 'NEG')]
the nakgi - bokum was horrible .####[([1, 2, 3], 'NEG')]
easily the worst stir - fried squid i 've ever tasted .####[([3, 4, 5, 6], 'NEG')]
the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean .####[([1], 'NEG')]
the side dishes were passable , and i did get a refill upon request .####[([1, 2], 'NEU')]
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service .####[([13], 'NEG')]
my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .####[([9], 'NEG')]
the wife had the risotto which was amazing .####[([4], 'POS')]
the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .####[([1, 2], 'POS'), ([5, 6, 7], 'POS')]
i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza####[([7, 8, 9], 'POS'), ([2, 3], 'POS')]
love this place , every time we are in the city this is one of the $ t$s we always go .####[([2], 'POS')]
a quintessential slice of nyc pizza .####[([2, 3, 4, 5], 'NEU')]
the crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .####[([1], 'POS'), ([12], 'POS'), ([26], 'POS')]
personally i like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .####[([4, 5], 'POS')]
possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city####[([4], 'POS')]
this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie ( that do n’t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !####[([5, 6, 7], 'POS')]
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you ’re no longer in the city .####[([11], 'NEU'), ([17, 18, 19], 'POS'), ([25], 'POS')]
if you ’re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .####[([25, 26], 'POS'), ([46, 47], 'POS')]
it ’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘ excuse me’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth !####[([16], 'POS')]
my party had the bbe $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !####[([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 'POS')]
we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .####[([6, 7, 8], 'POS')]
i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better .####[([3, 4, 5], 'POS'), ([19, 20, 21], 'POS')]
the sake ’s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
for desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .####[([6, 7, 8, 9], 'NEU'), ([17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25], 'POS')]
maybe it was the great company ( i had friends visiting from philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but i just ca n’t say enough good things about this brasserie .####[([42], 'POS')]
i do n’t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but i ’ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .####[([21], 'POS')]
the service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .####[([1], 'NEG')]
they are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !####[([11], 'NEG'), ([25], 'NEG'), ([28, 29], 'NEG')]
great shabu shabu####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
i tried a couple other dishes but was n't too impressed .####[([5], 'NEU')]
but for the shabu shabu , you wo n't find much better in ny .####[([3, 4], 'POS')]
the meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .####[([1], 'POS'), ([6], 'POS'), ([21], 'POS'), ([19], 'POS'), ([12], 'POS'), ([15], 'POS')]
dokebi gives williamsburg the right one - two punch of classic korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .####[([11, 12], 'POS'), ([14, 15], 'POS'), ([17, 18, 19], 'POS')]
the hot dogs are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun .####[([1, 2], 'POS'), ([18, 19, 20], 'POS'), ([27], 'POS')]
restaurant with a view####[([3], 'NEU')]
the food tasted very good .####[([1], 'POS')]

this place is not inviting and the food is totally weird .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([7], 'NEG')]
the concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n't work .####[([3, 4], 'NEG')]
the food they serve is not comforting , not appetizing and uncooked .####[([1], 'NEG')]
good food####[([1], 'POS')]
the food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , i do n't like being cramp in a corner .####[([1], 'POS'), ([9, 10], 'NEG')]
over all it was a very nice romantic place .####[([8], 'POS')]
a coworker and i tried pacifico after work a few fridays and loved it .####[([5], 'POS')]
the atmosphere was great .####[([1], 'POS')]
the food we ordered was excellent , although i would n't say the margaritas were anything to write home about .####[([1], 'POS'), ([13], 'NEU')]
our waitress was n't mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .####[([1], 'NEU')]
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .####[([12], 'POS')]
regardless , we 'll be back and ca n't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .####[([20], 'POS')]
the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .####[([1], 'NEG')]
a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .####[([2], 'NEG'), ([17], 'POS')]
overall the food quality was pretty good , though i hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest .####[([2], 'POS')]
the place has a nice fit - out , some attractive furnishings and , from what i could tell , a reasonable wine list ( i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins )####[([5, 6, 7], 'POS'), ([11], 'POS'), ([22, 23], 'POS')]
how is this palce still open ?####[([3], 'NEG')]
everything was going good until we got our meals .####[([8], 'NEG')]
i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled .####[([6], 'NEG')]
it was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .####[([12], 'NEG')]
i took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted $ t$ as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in flatbush farms .####[([8], 'NEG')]
at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the $ t$ walked away .####[([5], 'NEG')]
so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the $ t$ was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it .####[([18], 'NEG')]
this is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and i can not comp it .####[([10], 'NEG')]
the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([25], 'POS'), ([27], 'POS')]
this staff should be fired .####[([1], 'NEG')]

if i could give 0 stars i would do so for this place .####[([12], 'NEG')]
this place ... god where do i begin .####[([1], 'NEG')]
it is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that .####[([5], 'POS')]
the decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 frickin hours to come ! ! ! !####[([1], 'NEU'), ([22], 'NEG')]
how this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy , or any other for that matter , is beyond me .####[([2], 'NEG')]
great hot dogs !####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
though it 's been crowded most times i 've gone here , bark always delivers on their food .####[([17], 'POS'), ([12], 'NEU')]
the hot dogs are top notch , and they 're slamwich is amazing !####[([1, 2], 'POS'), ([10], 'POS')]
going to bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !####[([2], 'POS')]
only complaint is the pricing -- i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .####[([24], 'NEG')]
but nonetheless -- great spot , great food .####[([4], 'POS'), ([7], 'POS')]
fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off –####[([1], 'POS'), ([5, 6, 7, 8], 'NEG')]
each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return .####[([14], 'POS'), ([7, 8, 9, 10], 'NEG'), ([42, 43], 'POS')]
as bfc does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !####[([1], 'NEG'), ([21, 22, 23, 24], 'NEG')]
the frizzy retro girl ( with winged/ dame edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .####[([3], 'NEG')]
i 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !####[([6], 'NEG')]
there 's another girl who i ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 " with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're * really * talking about .####[([3], 'NEG')]
considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better service .####[([14], 'NEG')]
maitre - d -"eat and get out "####[([0, 1, 2], 'NEG')]

this guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .####[([49], 'NEG')]
a word to the wise : you ca n't dine here and disturb the maitre - d 's sense of " table turnover " , as whacked as it is , or else .####[([14, 15, 16], 'NEG')]
best meal in a long time !####[([1], 'POS')]

ca n’t believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .####[([7], 'NEG')]
the food is very good , but not outstanding .####[([1], 'NEU')]
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .####[([15], 'NEG'), ([18], 'NEG')]
mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff .####[([31], 'NEG')]
the bread was stale , the salad was overpriced and empty .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([6], 'NEG')]
the pasta was well cooked , did n't have enough sauce though or flavor .####[([1], 'POS')]
the hostess was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .####[([1], 'NEG')]
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .####[([18], 'NEG')]
i asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like i was insane .####[([8], 'NEG')]
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , " can i help you " and " how many are in your party . "####[([11], 'NEG')]
shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non - existent customer service .####[([8], 'NEG'), ([13, 14], 'NEG')]
bad staff####[([1], 'NEG')]
i generally like this place .####[([4], 'POS')]
the food is good .####[([1], 'POS')]
the design of the space is good .####[([4], 'POS')]
but the service is horrid !####[([2], 'NEG')]
i was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .####[([14], 'NEG'), ([17], 'NEG')]
the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .####[([1], 'NEG')]
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) .####[([1], 'NEG')]
i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would retrain the staff .####[([6], 'NEG'), ([16], 'NEG')]
