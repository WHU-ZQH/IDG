pros : the macbook pro notebook has a large battery life and you wont have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so .####[([9, 10], 'POS')]

Good price .####[([1], 'POS')]
THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !####[([1], 'NEG')]

Without a doubt , the * design * of this laptop is fantastic .####[([6], 'POS')]
I could n't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge .####[([7], 'POS'), ([12], 'POS')]
I could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left .####[([10], 'NEG')]
Other than that , I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities .####[([18], 'POS')]
This is the first time that I tried and owning a netbook although I have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years , I find not much difference except of course for the screen size .####[([35, 36], 'NEU')]

The backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]

Garageband is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone , good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level .####[([0], 'NEU'), ([16], 'POS')]
I dual boot with Linux and that other security-prone OS and it performs flawlessly .####[([4], 'NEU'), ([8, 9], 'NEU'), ([12], 'POS')]
The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space .####[([9], 'POS'), ([11, 12, 13], 'POS')]
There was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the iBook .####[([10, 11, 12], 'NEG'), ([19], 'NEU')]
Seems like maybe a bad shipment from Toshiba .####[([5], 'NEG')]
OS X is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time .####[([0, 1], 'POS'), ([10], 'POS')]
But other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers .####[([11], 'POS')]
The keyboard is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops I have had in the past .####[([1], 'POS')]
Overall , this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from .####[([13], 'POS'), ([19], 'POS')]

Many kinds of software that is necessary to the working person is not available and can not be downloaded .####[([3], 'NEG')]
I had to pay for the shipping !####[([6], 'NEG')]
It bluescreened on me without any warning , running simply basic Chrome .####[([11], 'NEG')]
I took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of laptops .####[([7], 'NEU')]
We researched and found the best price at MacConnection .####[([6], 'POS')]
But guess what ? -LRB- you have to buy an external dvd drive it does n't have a built in type -RRB- The notebook ca n't be used because it does n't read anything for an external drive .####[([10, 11, 12], 'NEG'), ([36, 37], 'NEG')]

No , tey do n't even support their own bios and it `` could be a problem with the bios '' How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity ??!!####[([9], 'NEG'), ([19], 'NEG')]
Because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time , we are on the hook for the repair .####[([6, 7], 'NEG')]
It started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in -LRB- mousing over the battery icon would read , for example , `` 74 % , plugged in , not charging '' -RRB- , requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge .####[([33], 'NEG'), ([7], 'NEG'), ([53], 'NEU')]
This laptop looked brand new and was shipped very quickly .####[([7], 'POS')]
Info : Windows failed to load because the kernal is missing , or corrupt .####[([2], 'NEG'), ([8], 'NEG')]
The display on this computer is the best I 've seen in a very long time , the battery life is very long and very convienent .####[([1], 'POS'), ([18, 19], 'POS')]
But the quality , in general was less than the worth of the cheap laptop .####[([2], 'NEG')]
In the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced .####[([9], 'NEG')]
Its also FUN to use !####[([4], 'POS')]
The graphics and screen are stunning and although I was a PC person , I was able to understand how to use a mac fairly quickly .####[([1], 'POS'), ([3], 'POS')]
WIth the upgraded memory , the MacBook Pro never has an issue running many many applications at once !####[([2, 3], 'POS'), ([15], 'NEU'), ([12], 'POS')]

Apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth , they come loose .####[([3], 'NEU'), ([12], 'NEU')]
Being a PC user my whole life , it 's taking a bit of time to adapt to the OS of a Mac but I 'm finding my way around .####[([19], 'NEU')]
The computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan .####[([30], 'NEG')]
I have in the past gotten superfine sandpaper and `` fixed '' the edges by rounding them off .####[([13], 'NEG')]
Downfalls : sharp edges .####[([3], 'NEG')]
i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria .####[([7], 'NEU')]

I had it four months when my disc drive refused to open .####[([7, 8], 'NEG')]
So , after Apple replaced the hard drive I enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer , until it froze this morning -- completely .####[([6, 7], 'NEU')]
Once again , I was told it was the suspicious power supply problem .####[([10, 11], 'NEG')]

The guy then said that if I insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but I have to accept the condition after the `` repair '' .####[([11], 'NEU')]
The port is secured to motherboard so when this happens you ca n't see the plug at all , it 's just gone .####[([5], 'NEU'), ([1], 'NEU'), ([15], 'NEG')]
I love the feel of the key board , as well as the trackpad .####[([6, 7], 'POS'), ([13], 'POS')]
Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac !####[([12], 'POS'), ([14], 'POS')]
Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac .####[([2], 'POS')]

But , buy this model and just purchase 4GB of RAM -LRB- 2x2GB for $ 92 or 1x4GB for $ 99 -RRB- , and save yourself $ 100 than the other model with 8GB of RAM .####[([8, 9, 10], 'NEU'), ([33, 34, 35], 'NEU')]
If you 're looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphics-intensive game , you 'd be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market .####[([16], 'NEU')]
Browsing , also , was no problem for me when I used itunes -LRB- which usually slows down my PC -RRB- .####[([0], 'POS'), ([12], 'POS')]
Again , decent comp for the price , and I was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me .####[([6], 'POS')]
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop .####[([28], 'NEG')]
My friend just had to replace his entire motherboard , so did my wife , and it looks like I will have to as well .####[([8], 'NEG')]
Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and I am not kidding you , I called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them .####[([0, 1, 2], 'NEG')]

This computer I used daily nice compact design .####[([7], 'POS')]

It was hard to handle and operate at school .####[([4], 'NEG'), ([6], 'NEG')]
It has easy to use features and all the speed and power I could ask for .####[([5], 'POS'), ([9], 'POS'), ([11], 'POS')]
My power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership , so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan .####[([1, 2, 3], 'NEG'), ([20, 21, 22], 'POS')]
I preferred the fit and feel of the 13 inch .####[([8, 9], 'POS')]

After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs -LRB- delivery service was slow , and without the laptop I had no access to the internet , and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again -RRB- , it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years .####[([12, 13], 'NEG')]
My friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance , picture quality , and ease of use .####[([8], 'POS'), ([10, 11], 'POS'), ([16], 'POS')]

See when it comes to laptops you buy it and get just a normal operating system with trials of must need stuff that should come with it .####[([14, 15], 'NEU')]
The only thing I do n't understand is that the resolution of the screen is n't high enough for some pages , such as Yahoo!Mail .####[([10, 11, 12, 13], 'NEG')]
The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16 '' laptop does .####[([14], 'NEG')]

The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely .####[([5, 6], 'NEG')]

I wish Toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the OS at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff .####[([15], 'NEU')]

Right size and weight for portability .####[([1], 'POS'), ([3], 'POS'), ([5], 'POS')]
The battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .####[([1, 2], 'NEG')]
It was loaded with Windows Vista Home Premium -- delivered with only 1GB of RAM , and it was a * dog * .####[([4, 5, 6, 7], 'NEU'), ([12, 13, 14], 'NEG')]
The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me -LRB- I prefer it dark -RRB- or if you can crank up the brightness .####[([4], 'NEG'), ([32], 'NEU')]
My one complaint with this laptop is that I 've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in .####[([12, 13, 14], 'NEG'), ([19, 20], 'NEG')]

Again in February my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load Windows so I contacted Acer to get it fixed thru my Warrenty and it took about 3 days fighting on the phone with agents and it seemed as though NONE of them spoke English .####[([15], 'NEU'), ([26], 'NEU'), ([38], 'NEG')]

In due course , I 'll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash .####[([8, 9], 'NEG')]
They break down just as often as PCs do , and the only reason they do n't get viruses , is because no one makes viruses for them , they 're not better in any way , they are worse , try finding virus protection programs for a Mac , they do n't exist .####[([43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48], 'NEG')]

The speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones I have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music I suggest you get something better .####[([1], 'NEG')]
So then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair -LRB- the price of a new one -RRB- .####[([67], 'NEG')]

Sure , the initial out of pocket expense is greater , but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet , and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs , it probably comes out about even anyhow .####[([7], 'NEG'), ([23], 'POS')]
The best thing to do is build your own computer , but if u ca n't company 's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $ 2000 systems and if you google `` dell coupons '' you can find codes that take a signifant amount off the price .####[([26], 'POS'), ([33], 'POS'), ([67], 'POS')]
There is no cd drive on the computer , which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd .####[([3, 4], 'NEG')]
